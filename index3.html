        <h2>The Qur'an</h2>
        <p>
          Muslims believe that the Qur'an, the holy book of Islam, was revealed
          to Muhammad over a period of twenty-three years, starting with the
          initial revelation at Mount Hira. After the Prophet's death, his
          successors compiled these divine revelations in a manuscript. The
          Qur'an contains prayers, moral guidance, historical narrative, and
          promises of Paradise. It opens with a short prayer called the Fatiha,
          the most widely recited passage, and is divided into 114 chapters
          (suras) organized in descending length. For binding and reading
          purposes, manuscripts of the Qur'an are often divided into thirty
          equal parts, called juz'.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every chapter of the Qur'an (except one) begins with the bismillah,
          the collective name for the invocation "In the name of God, the
          Compassionate, the Merciful." Muslims often repeat this phrase at the
          start of an event or task—before giving a speech, beginning a meal, or
          even boarding a bus. The calligraphic bismillah is frequently written
          on both religious and secular objects.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Qur'an places Muhammad at the end of a long line of prophets that
          began with Abraham. Although narrative is not central to the Qur'an,
          it includes the stories of Noah, Moses, and Jesus. It recognizes Jews
          and Christians as "People of the Book"; as a result, Muslims accept
          many of the teachings of the Jewish Torah and Christian Bible. Many of
          the great Islamic empires (like those in Spain, Iran, India, and
          Turkey) were tolerant of religious minorities.
