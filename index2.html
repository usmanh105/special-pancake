          The Night Journey and Ascension of the Prophet
        </h3>
        <p class="night-journey1">
          Accounts of the ascension (mi'rajâ€Š) of Muhammad have captured the
          imaginations of writers and painters for centuries. One night, while
          the Prophet was sleeping, the Archangel Gabriel came and led him on a
          journey. Mounted on the heavenly steed Buraq, Muhammad traveled from
          the Ka'ba in Mecca to the "Farthest Mosque," which Muslims believe to
          be the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem. There he prayed with other
          prophets such as Moses, Abraham, and Jesus, and ascended to the skies,
          where he was led by Gabriel through Paradise and Hell, and finally
          came face to face with God. He then returned to earth to continue
          spreading the message of Islam. According to Islamic belief, Muhammad
          was the only person to see Heaven and Hell while still alive.

        <p class="life-p">
          Muhammad was born into the most powerful tribe in Mecca, the Quraish,
          around 570 A.D. The power of the Quraish derived from their role as
          successful merchants. Several trade routes intersected at Mecca,
          allowing the Quraish to control trade along the west coast of Arabia,
          north to Syria, and south to Yemen. Mecca was home to two widely
          venerated polytheistic cults whose gods were thought to protect its
          lucrative trade. After working for several years as a merchant,
          Muhammad was hired by Khadija, a wealthy widow, to ensure the safe
          passage of her caravans to Syria. They eventually married.

        <h4 class="depictions">Depictions of the Prophet Muhammad</h4>
        <p class="depictions-p">
          Featured in this unit are several depictions of the Prophet Muhammad.
          These portrayals, while somewhat rare, are not unheard of as there
          were (and still are) many different attitudes toward depicting the
          Prophet, and humans in general, in the Islamic world. These attitudes
          varied dramatically from region to region and throughout history; the
          societies that produced the works discussed here are among those that
          allowed the depiction of the Prophet. Commissioned by Muslims for
          Muslims, these images appear in biographies of the Prophet and his
          family, world and local histories, and accounts of Muhammad's
          celestial journey (mi'raj), as well as in literary texts. In each
          context, they serve a distinct purpose. They illustrate a narrative in
          biographies and histories, while in literary texts they serve as
          visual analogues to written praises of the Prophet. An image of the
          Prophet Muhammad at the beginning of a book endows the volume with the
          highest form of blessing and sanctity. Thus, illustration of him was a
          common practice, particularly in the eastern regions of the Islamic
          world
