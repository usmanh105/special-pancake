            <h3 id="h3-heading1">Who is Prophet Muhammad</h3>
            <p id="early-life">Prophet Muhammed (PBUH) is the prophet for entire mankind, he was a man chosen by God himself to represent the muslim nation. A muslim can be anyone who believes in 1 GOD, you don't have to be a certain race or have a certain skill color
                to become one. You may not know what Islam is but can still believe in 1 GOD you are classified as a muslim. There was reason why God chose him to be the final messenger, he was a flawless man with so many amazing qualities. He was kind, truthful, modest
                just, truthful, ethical, patient. It was as if he had designed himself. Prophet Muhammad was listed number 1 in the list of the most influential people to ever live in a book that was researched for 3 years by a man named Michael heart.

             <h3 id="h3-heading2">His role in Islam</h3>
              <p id="links-to-islam">We muslims believe that prophet Muhammad is the final messenger sent to mankind after prophet Jesus who is widely known in christianity. We muslims believe that Jesus was just a human like Prophet Muhammad, and that Jesus did not die in a cross
                  and that he was saved by GOD before he was about to die on the cross. Prophet Muhammad was almost like a teacher to mankind. He taught the muslims at the time how to live the best way possible in order to please GOD. He was sent with the message of strict monotheism basically
                  to guide people by telling them their true purpose in life and that was to believe in creator and the God should be worshiped alone and that we should no create our own versions of God as their abode will be the fire of hell where no soul shall be able to live or die. It is because God will 
                  only allow people to enter his kingdom of paradise if you truly believe in him. This is why muslims believe that this life is just a test to see who believes in God and who is the best in deeds.

                    During the spreading of Islam, many battles were fought to protect this religoun. These include the battles of Badr, Uhud, Khandak, and many more. The Prophet and his companions fought bravely in all these wars and defended Islam even at the cost of their own lives.
                    
                    The Mercy of the Companions and the Prophet SAW
                    Whenever the Prophet or his companions were wronged, they never retaliated violently or let their emotions overcome themselves. The Prophet always reacted to mistreatment from the Kuffar with mercy and forgiveness. He treated everone with utmost care. Even when people hit him he never reacted violently unless he was in war. He is the absolute best role model for the entire Ummah.
